Some projects I've worked on include an e-ink todo display in C++ ([here](https://github.com/yutotakano/e-paper-todoist)), a 5G packet core implementation in Rust ([here](https://github.com/yutotakano/corekube-rs)), a 3D game built from scratch in C# ([here](https://github.com/HammeredGame/Hammered)), an Haskell library for VoIP calls ([here](https://github.com/yutotakano/discord-haskell-voice)), and a Lua script for the mpv video player ([here](https://github.com/yutotakano/mpvcord)).

Please don't hestitate to reach out regarding any of these! :)
